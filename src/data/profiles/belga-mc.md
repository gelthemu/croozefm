Meet Belga MC, a dynamic radio presenter who turned his childhood dream of mimicking broadcasters in Kampala into reality. Now co-hosting the [Morning Addiction](/shows/morning-addiction) on Crooze FM weekdays from 6 AM with [Monique](/i/monique-mbabazi) and [Derrick](/i/derrick-ashiimwe), he’s a Western Uganda favorite.

Radio is Belga’s passion—he’s not just a host but a producer and voice-over artist with a standout voice, dubbed the “best on radio.” He also rocks the [Fat Friday Mix](/shows/fat-friday-mix) with [DJ Emma](/i/deejay-emma) every Friday from 8 PM till late.

His big break came in December 2020 when he ranked among the top three in a Crooze FM talent search, earning him training and a spot on the station. From those early wins, he’s now a regional star, loved for his energy and skill.

Beyond radio, he enjoys socializing and exploring the digital world.
