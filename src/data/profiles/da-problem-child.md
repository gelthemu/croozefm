Steve, now known as Da Problem Child, is the lively voice you hear on Crooze FM. As a kid, he dreamed big, and with no Netflix back then, radio was his escape. He fell in love with not just listening but creating those magical moments on air.

He’s not in it for the fame but for the joy of making listeners feel something special. That’s what gets him excited every time he hits the studio.

Why Da Problem Child? It's not because he was a rebel, but because he brought such crazy, fun energy to the [Evening Switch](/shows/evening-switch) that "Steve" just didn't fit anymore. Now, he's known for being a 'problem on air' - in the best way possible!

Outside of causing a ruckus on the radio, he's actually pretty laid-back. He loves how radio lets him be himself and connect with his 'radio family' every day. The job keeps him learning, growing, and always on his toes.

His highlight of the week? Hosting [The Most Wanted Xtra](/shows/tgif-most-wanted-extra) every Friday from 2:00 PM, where he vibes with DJ Modern, the Scratch Maven. It's more than a show; it's his therapy with beats.
