A devastating fire broke out at the Sunrise Hotel along Khamis Road in downtown Kampala, Uganda, on Wednesday morning, March 5, 2025, leaving at least three people dead and several others injured. The blaze, which erupted earlier today, continues to challenge emergency response teams as rescue operations persist into the afternoon.

Police fire brigade units, supported by Uganda Red Cross personnel, are battling to extinguish the flames that have ravaged the multi-story building. Thick smoke and intense heat have complicated efforts, with authorities warning that the death toll may rise as search and rescue operations continue.

The cause of the fire is under investigation, with preliminary reports suggesting a possible explosion at a soap-making outlet within the hotel may have sparked the disaster. Kampala Metropolitan Police, led by SSP Moses Nanoka, Regional Police Commander for Kampala Metropolitan North, have yet to release a final casualty count but have pledged a comprehensive report once the situation stabilizes.

Ms. Minsa Kabanda, Minister of Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) and Metropolitan Area, reported that scores of survivors have been evacuated to various health facilities, including a clinic in Kisenyi, a Kampala suburb, for urgent medical care. Ambulances from the Uganda Police Force (UPF) and Uganda Red Cross were seen shuttling survivors to safety amidst the chaos.

Eyewitness accounts paint a grim picture of the tragedy. One survivor described a man attempting to flee through a window, only to fall to his death. “He was wrapped in a towel, but it slipped off as he panicked. He fell, struck his head on the pavement, and died instantly,” the witness recounted. Other occupants were forced to leap from upper floors as flames engulfed escape routes, adding to the mounting injuries.

Kampala City Lord Mayor Erias Lukwago has decried the city’s inadequate firefighting capacity, calling for immediate action. “The fire started early this morning, yet hours later it still rages. This shows our fire brigade lacks the manpower and resources to contain such disasters—a serious issue that must be addressed urgently,” he said. The incident echoes a troubling trend of fire outbreaks in Kampala, including the late 2024 blaze at Park Yard Market, raising renewed concerns over public safety.

Property worth millions of shillings has been reduced to ashes, with images revealing extensive damage to the hotel’s structure. As investigations into the fire’s origin continue, authorities and residents alike are left grappling with the aftermath of yet another deadly inferno in the capital
