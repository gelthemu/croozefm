The billionaire chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway says tariffs are "an act of war, to some degree."

"Over time, they are a tax on goods. I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn't pay 'em!" he said in an interview with "CBS News Sunday Morning" when asked how tariffs would impact inflation. "And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, 'And then what?'"

When asked about the current economy, Buffett said: "Well, I think that's the most interesting subject in the world, but I won't talk, I can't talk about it, though. I really can't." He also didn't answer further questions about the political environment.

The 94-year-old, known as the Oracle of Omaha, has said he's staying out of politics and holding his tongue on divisive topics because speaking out could spark public backlash against Berkshire, potentially harming shareholders and forcing the company's subsidiaries to lay off workers.

"So, I've decidedly backed off â€” I don't want to say anything that'll get attributed, basically, to [Berkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway), and have somebody else bear the consequences of what I talk about," Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2022.

The lover of American stocks like Apple and Coca-Cola told CBS that "a majority of any money I manage will always be in the United States" because "it's the best place."

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has announced or threatened tariffs against several countries. Economists have warned that the US imposing tariffs would likely hurt the domestic economy and that additional costs would likely be passed on to the American consumer rather than to foreign exporters.

Trump proposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that were initially supposed to take effect in February but were postponed. They are now expected to start Tuesday, though Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said they may not be at a 25% rate.

After placing a 10% tariff on goods from China last month, Trump announced on Thursday he'd impose another 10% tariff on the country, saying it hasn't done enough to stop fentanyl from entering the US.

Trump also announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports to the US, which is set to take effect on March 12.

He said last month that he'd charge "a reciprocal tariff" on countries that have such taxes on American goods.

He's also threatened to impose a 25% tariff on European Union countries and said he'd slap a 100% tariff on BRICS nations if they replaced the US dollar as their reserve currency.

Buffett has supported presidential candidates in the past, including backing Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but he declined to make an endorsement in the 2024 election.

Based on his past comments, he was likely worried about alienating half the country and harming his conglomerate's nearly 400,000 workers and many shareholders.
