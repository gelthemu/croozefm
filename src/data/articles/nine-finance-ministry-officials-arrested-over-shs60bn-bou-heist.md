Nine officials from Uganda’s Ministry of Finance have been arrested following a rigorous interrogation by the Criminal Investigation Department at its headquarters in Kibuli, Kampala.

Sources privy to the investigations have told the Nile Post that these officials may have knowledge regarding the mysterious disappearance of Shs60 billion from the Bank of Uganda last year.

Those detained include the Accountant General, Lawrence Ssemakula, along with Paul Lumala, Jennifer Muhulizi, Mubarak Nsamba, and Mark Kasuku.

Others are Tony Yawe, Deborah Kusiima, Betinah Nayebare, and Judith Ashaba.

The suspects are currently being held at Kira and Nateete Police Stations in Kampala as investigations intensify.

The saga began last year when it was discovered that the Bank of Uganda had transferred Shs60 billion, but the funds were erroneously deposited into incorrect accounts in Japan and the United Kingdom.

At the tail-end of November, reports surfaced that security agencies were investigating the disappearance of billions of shillings from the central bank in what was being treated as an inside job.

It would take weeks for Bank of Uganda confirm the heist with deputy governor Michael Atingi-Ego saying money meant for debt repayments to the Word Bank and African Development Fund was diverted from its intended destinations to two banks in the UK and Japan.

In a news briefing on December 5, Mr Atingi-Ego said two "fraudulent incidents" had diverted money destined for the World Bank and African Development Fund.

However, he denied reports that the central bank’s systems had been hacked, saying the fraud had been initiated outside Bank of Uganda.

“There were two transactions, which were relating to debt servicing payments. The payments transactions in question included a payment to the World Bank of $6.134m, which was instead paid to Road Way Company in Japan," Atingi-Ego said.

"And then the second payment was meant to be a payment to the African Development Fund of $8.569m, it was instead paid to NJS International, London, UK on September 28."

On Tuesday morning, as word of the ongoing interrogations spread, Police vehicles were seen shuttling between CID headquarters and local police stations.

By mid-morning, two police drone vehicles were spotted leaving the CID premises, escorted by police patrol trucks heading toward Kira and Nateete Police Stations.

Police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke confirmed the arrests, noting that the investigation is still ongoing.

"We have nine persons in custody as part of our investigation into the missing funds. More details will follow as the inquiry progresses," Rusoke said.

The scandal has not only raised concerns over internal controls within the Ministry of Finance but also prompted calls for greater accountability in handling public funds.

As of now, both the police and the Ministry of Finance have refrained from making an official statement on the matter.
