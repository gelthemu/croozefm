Heads of secondary schools in Greater Kabale District have raised concerns about the challenges facing the implementation of the new abridged A-Level curriculum, citing issues such as inadequate teacher orientation, a lack of essential materials, and insufficient retooling.

A survey conducted across schools in Kabale, Rubanda, and Rukiga districts highlighted significant gaps in the curriculum’s rollout, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive teacher training.

Pamela Kamwesiga, Director of Studies at Kigezi College Butobere, pointed out the difficulties teachers are facing in adapting to the changes, particularly since many educators have only taught traditional A-Level subjects and have not been properly introduced to the new content.

She stressed the importance of textbooks specifically tailored to the updated curriculum and called on the government to provide these critical resources to support effective teaching.

Amon Mwesigye Byaruhanga, head teacher of Kabale Secondary School, revealed that although the National Curriculum Development Center (NCDC) had initially assured teachers that the curriculum would remain unchanged, there have been unexpected modifications, particularly with regard to the number of examination papers per subject.

He expressed concern that this uncertainty is hindering teachers’ ability to prepare students adequately and urged the NCDC to provide clearer communication on the structure of exams to facilitate better preparation.

Meanwhile, George Aturebiire Tumusiime, head teacher of Hornby High School, argued that while the new curriculum may not be entirely unfamiliar to students, minor adjustments in subject content have been made.

He acknowledged the need for refresher courses and retooling sessions but expressed confidence that the changes could be smoothly integrated into the teaching and learning process.

Abraham Akampurira, head teacher of Kigezi High School, highlighted the overcrowding in libraries and computer labs, which is exacerbated by the high number of students seeking access to learning materials.

He called for better infrastructure and additional resources to ensure that all students have equal access to learning tools, particularly in the digital age.

Akampurira also emphasized the need for government-provided training on new teaching methodologies to enhance the implementation of the curriculum.

Amos Ahimbisibwe, head teacher of Bubare Secondary School, mentioned that his school has been in close contact with the NCDC and Uganda National Examinations Board for orientation on the new curriculum, but noted that adapting to the new system remains challenging for teachers.

These concerns reflect a wider need for better preparation, resources, and support to ensure a smooth transition to the new abridged A-Level curriculum.
