Golf legend Tiger Woods faces another major setback in his storied career, as he has undergone surgery to repair a ruptured left Achilles tendon, an injury sustained during intensified training at home.

The procedure, performed by Dr. Charlton Stucken at the Hospital for Special Surgery in West Palm Beach, Florida, was described as minimally invasive, but it has forced Woods, now 49, to miss the prestigious 2025 Masters Tournament scheduled for April.

This injury compounds the challenges Woods has faced in recent years, including multiple back surgeries and a severe car crash in 2021, further testing his resilience as he aims to return to championship-level golf.

The surgery’s timing, just weeks before the Masters, casts significant doubt on his participation in any of the 2025 major championships, including the PGA Championship, U.S. Open, and The Open Championship.

In a statement, Woods expressed optimism about his rehabilitation, thanking his fans for their unwavering support and emphasizing his commitment to a full recovery.

However, Dr. Stucken did not provide a specific timeline for Woods’ return, leaving golf enthusiasts uncertain about when the 15-time major champion might tee off again.

Woods’ absence from the Masters, where he has won a record-tying five green jackets, is a significant blow to the tournament and the sport, but his history of overcoming injuries—such as returning from a 2023 Achilles injury as quarterback Aaron Rodgers did—offers hope for a comeback.

For now, Woods remains focused on healing, while the golf world awaits news of his recovery and potential return to the fairways.
