[Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbarara_University) is on the brink of a major crisis. The Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council (UMDPC) and the Uganda National Council for Higher Education (UNCHE) have sounded the alarm, warning that the university’s dilapidated infrastructure could force it to shut its doors. This isn’t just a slap on the wrist—it’s a red alert for an institution long hailed as a pillar of medical education in Uganda.

During a recent inspection—the fifth in a series with no real progress—UMDPC Vice Chairman Dr. Ayub Twaha didn’t mince words. He pointed to the university’s crumbling biomedical science labs, calling them a “threat to medical training.” These facilities, he stressed, fall far short of the standards needed to churn out competent doctors and health pros. It’s a grim picture: outdated equipment, decaying structures, and a ticking clock as regulators lose patience.

For years, MUST has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with giants like Makerere University, shaping Uganda’s healthcare future since its launch in 1989. But now, the spotlight’s on its failures. The UMDPC, which oversees medical and dental standards under the 1996 Act, insists safe training spaces aren’t optional—they’re a must to protect public health.

The pressure’s on to refurbish those labs, but details are scarce. No timelines, no plans—just a loud call from regulators to get it done. This isn’t just a MUST problem; it’s a wake-up call for Uganda’s tertiary education scene, where cash-strapped schools struggle to keep up with modern demands. The university’s rep and its ability to produce top-tier medics hang in the balance, and time’s running out.

So, what’s next for MUST? As of today, March 4, 2025, we’re still in the dark on refurbishment moves. One thing’s clear: this Mbarara City gem needs a lifeline, fast. Stay tuned to Crooze FM for updates as this story unfolds—because when it comes to training our future doctors, there’s no room for compromise.
