### Jay Z Fights Back Against Defamation

Music mogul Jay Z is no stranger to the spotlight, but this time, he’s stepping into the courtroom to defend his name. A woman who accused the rapper of assault has found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit after Jay Z filed a countersuit, alleging her claims are nothing more than a calculated attempt to extort money. According to the star, the accuser went public with what he calls baseless allegations, tarnishing his reputation in the media with cries of “rapist” and “ predator.”

Jay Z’s legal team asserts that the endgame was a payoff to keep her quiet—an offer he clearly didn’t take. “Before you accuse someone, especially high-profile figures, you’d better have evidence,” [Inyaa Clare](/i/inyaa-clare) remarked. With the matter now in the courts, the accuser may find it tough to walk back her claims. With both sides dug in, this legal showdown promises to be a messy one, and the accuser may find the road ahead far from smooth. Stay tuned to Crooze FM as this story unfolds.

### Willy Mukabya Trades the Mic for the Pulpit

In a surprising career pivot, Kadongo Kamu legend Willy Mukabya is trading his microphone for a pulpit. Known for his storytelling prowess through the traditional single-guitar music style, the artist has long been a household name in the country’s music scene. Now, he’s embracing a new title: Pastor Willy Mukabya.

The musician recently announced the launch of his own church, citing a “deep spiritual urge” to serve God and minister to others. “I’ve dedicated myself to this calling,” he said in a statement. So from now on, prepend “Pastor” to his name as a sign of respect. For fans of his soulful tunes, this shift might feel unexpected, but Willy Mukabya’s knack for weaving narratives seems tailor-made for the sermon circuit. Could this be the start of a new chapter for one of Uganda’s finest? Only time—and perhaps a few hymns—will tell.

### Vinka Stays Put at Swangs Avenue

Rumors have been swirling for months about unrest at Swangs Avenue, with whispers that artists like Vinka, Winnie Nwagi, and Elijah Kitaka were ready to jump ship over an allegedly “unsafe” and “unsexy” working environment. But Vinka, one of the label’s biggest stars, is putting those speculations to rest.

“I’m not leaving Swangs Avenue,” she declared firmly, dispelling the gossip that’s been haunting her career trajectory. Having spent over a decade with the label—first as Irene Ntale’s manager and later as a successful artist in her own right—Vinka credits Swangs for her rise to fame. “They’ve been there for me when it comes to music,” she said. “I’m comfortable with everything they’ve done and continue to do. I’m happy and winning musically.”

Still, as the saying goes, there’s no smoke without fire. With ongoing chatter about Swangs Avenue’s internal dynamics, industry watchers are keeping a close eye on the label. For now, though, Vinka’s loyalty stands firm—a rare constant in an ever-shifting entertainment landscape.
