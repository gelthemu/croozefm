The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), the agency responsible for protecting Uganda’s environment, has resumed its operation to evict dwellers from wetlands across the country.

In a press statement released on March 10, Mr William Lubuulwa, the spokesperson for NEMA, announced that the restoration activities, which began with the demolition of houses in the Kaliddubi wetland in the Munyonyo area, will continue in other regions where notices had been issued.

“Our operation focused on addressing key environmental violations, including makeshift structures built with iron sheets, semi-permanent business and residential structures,” Mr Lubuulwa stated.

Additional issues to be tackled include the backfilling of wetlands with murram, the creation of artificial drainage channels diverting wetland water, and the cultivation of crops such as banana suckers, yams, maize, and flower gardens.

The Kaliddubi wetland, which originates in Makindye Ssabagabo in Wakiso District, historically extends to Wankulukuku in Rubaga Division, crossing Entebbe Road before draining into Lake Victoria at Munyonyo.

“NEMA remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting Uganda’s wetlands and urges all stakeholders to support conservation efforts. Any attempts to re-encroach on the restored sections of Kaliddubi wetland will be met with strict enforcement measures,” Mr Lubuulwa warned.

Last year in May, a major restoration exercise took place, causing a stir among wetland dwellers. Encroachers of the Lubigi swamp in Wakiso District were forcefully evicted, with several houses demolished during a month-long restoration operation.

The operation was halted following intervention from political leaders, led by Kampala Lord Mayor Erias Lukwago. He called for the establishment of a district environment committee, which had not been in place before the demolition of houses in Kampala.

The intervention came after some areas of Kawaala, Bwaise, and Katoogo Village were designated for demolition. Schools in the affected areas were also affected, with some buildings being pulled down by NEMA enforcement teams. The remaining residents were issued restoration orders to vacate the wetlands.

Other areas, such as Nakuwadde-Bbira, were also issued similar notices, with several houses, including multi-million-dollar mansions, earmarked for demolition.
