The 8th edition of the Corporate Games officially kicked on Sunday, 3rd March 2025 at the NEC playgrounds in Bugolobi, Kampala city.

It was a befitting start exactly as it had been marketed prior. The Airforce band led the teams to march onto the field.

They all showed up in their very well designed and branded game kits and jerseys exuding enthusiasm and excitement I had not seen in a hot minute geared up to fully represent which lit up my already lit day as I smiled from ear to ear watching them come in.

The sponsors NBS sports were live on the field covering all the highlights while UZIMA water sponsored and supplied water to all participating companies free of charge to quench off from the heat of the day.
