The Anti-Corruption Court in Kampala has granted bail to Gladys Ithugu, one of the suspects in the Kitagwenda drug theft case (CRB 438/2024), while the ruling on her co-accused has been postponed.

Speaking to Crooze FM, Dr. Warren Namara, Executive Director of the State House Health Monitoring Unit (HMU), confirmed the development, stating that despite the State’s objection, the court proceeded to grant Ithugu bail during its Tuesday session.

Meanwhile, her co-accused, including Ronald Mukama Asiimwe, an assistant inventory management officer at Ntara Health Centre IV, and Allan Mumbere, who was caught transporting the stolen drugs on a boda boda, are still awaiting the court’s decision.

Another suspect, Julius Businge, a health information assistant at Mahyoro Health Centre III, remains on the run.

The suspects face charges of illegally trading essential medicines and medical equipment meant for public health facilities.

Authorities intercepted the stolen supplies, including Paracetamol tablets, Cotrimoxazole capsules, and gloves labeled “Government of Uganda – Not for Sale”, at Kyendangara Trading Centre in Mahyoro Town Council.
