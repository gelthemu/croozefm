The Las Vegas Raiders have locked in star defensive end Maxx Crosby with a lucrative three-year contract extension worth $106.5 million, including $91.5 million guaranteed. This deal cements Crosby as the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history, reflecting his immense value to the franchise.

Drafted in the fourth round in 2019 out of Eastern Michigan, Crosby has developed into one of the league’s most dominant pass rushers. Over six seasons, he has amassed 364 tackles, 105 tackles for loss, 59.5 sacks, and nine forced fumbles, solidifying his place among the best defensive linemen in the NFL.

Crosby’s consistency has been a key factor in his rise, earning him four consecutive Pro Bowl selections, tied for second-most in Raiders history among defensive linemen. In 2024, despite playing only 12 games before undergoing season-ending ankle surgery, he still led the team in sacks (7.5), tackles for loss (17), and quarterback pressures (35).

The 27-year-old has made a habit of rewriting franchise records. His 364 tackles are the most by a Raiders defensive lineman in their first six seasons, while his 59.5 sacks rank third in team history. He has also led the NFL in tackles for loss since 2019, further proving his elite status.

Speaking on his historic deal, Crosby emphasized that his focus remains on football, leadership, and winning. “The money is obviously incredible for my family, my kids, and my future kids. But it doesn’t change my approach. I’m still going to be here the same time every single day and put the work in,” he stated.

This extension marks the third time in four years that the Raiders have upgraded Crosby’s contract, underscoring their commitment to keeping him as the face of their defense. His relentless work ethic and leadership make him a cornerstone of the franchise’s future.

With this new deal, the Raiders ensure that Crosby remains a dominant force in Silver and Black, anchoring their defensive front as they look to build a championship-caliber team.
