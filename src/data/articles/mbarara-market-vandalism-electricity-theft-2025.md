**Mbarara, Uganda** – A wave of concern has swept through Mbarara City South division following the reported theft of electricity meters from the Level Four section of Mbarara Central Market, a vital commercial center in southwestern Uganda. The incident, highlighted during the [Morning Addiction](/shows/morning-addiction)'s 'The Awakening' segment has sparked outrage among local councilors and vendors, who are now demanding urgent remedies to address the vandalism and its financial impact.

Councilors led by Nyamityoobora Ward’s Amos Katureebe have pressed town clerk Didas Muhanguzi to explain the theft, which has left market vendors facing unexpectedly high electricity bills. Muhanguzi assured the council that efforts are underway to find a service provider to manage the market’s electricity, but the incident has exposed deeper issues of security, infrastructure maintenance, and governance at one of Uganda’s key markets.

Mbarara Central Market, home to 1,403 vendors, is a cornerstone of the region’s economy, [generating significant revenue—Shs 1.25 billion between January and February 2024 alone](/news/article/government-refutes-claims-of-vendor-exodus-at-mbarara-central-market). However, the theft of electricity meters underscores a persistent challenge in Uganda: electricity theft and vandalism, which a 2023 ScienceDirect study identified as major barriers to electricity security and the adoption of renewable energy sources in the country.

### Community Reactions and Proposed Solutions

The X thread following Crooze FM’s post reveals a range of reactions and suggestions from the public. Listeners expressed frustration, with some, like Prince Levi El-khan, proposing the installation of CCTV cameras to identify and deter vandals. Crooze FM Admin responded skeptically, questioning the effectiveness of existing CCTV systems on roads.

Others, including Kash West, called for broader systemic change, arguing that the “regime is tired” and pointing to widespread complaints about infrastructure issues like bridges, garbage, and roadside lights. Green wood Shaggy urged the installation of CCTV cameras and stronger laws to prevent such incidents, warning that unchecked vandalism could lead to increased deaths from electrical hazards. Black Mcee and Criscent Sajja lsingiro echoed calls for accountability, with the latter noting the common saying, “Everyone eats where he or she works,” implying potential internal complicity.

### Broader Context and Challenges

The vandalism at Mbarara Central Market is not an isolated incident but part of a larger pattern of electricity theft and infrastructure mismanagement in Uganda. The [ScienceDirect study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421522006309?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=9267ad0209c606c3) highlighted that rural and urban households struggle with electricity affordability, with many resorting to illegal connections or theft due to high costs and unreliable service. In urban areas like Mbarara, where monthly utility revenue is significantly higher than in rural regions, the financial burden on vendors—already exacerbated by meter theft—could drive further economic strain.

Didas Muhanguzi, the town clerk tasked with addressing this issue, has a track record of navigating financial mismanagement challenges in Ugandan municipalities. A 2020 Red Pepper report noted his role in addressing similar issues in Bushenyi Ishaka Municipality, suggesting experience but also raising questions about why such problems persist.
Calls for Action

Local leaders and the public are united in their demand for actionable solutions. Suggestions range from enhanced security measures, such as CCTV installations, to stricter laws and better oversight of market operations. However, skepticism about the effectiveness of current systems, like road CCTV cameras, indicates a need for innovative and locally tailored approaches. As an X user, Black Mcee pointed out, with the 2026 elections approaching, governance and infrastructure issues like these could become pivotal in shaping public opinion and political outcomes.

For now, Mbarara Central Market remains a symbol of both economic vitality and vulnerability. The theft of electricity meters is a wake-up call for authorities to strengthen security, improve accountability, and ensure that this critical hub continues to serve its vendors and the broader community effectively. As Crooze FM continues to amplify these concerns, the pressure is on Didas Muhanguzi and the Mbarara City Council to deliver tangible solutions before the problem escalates further.
