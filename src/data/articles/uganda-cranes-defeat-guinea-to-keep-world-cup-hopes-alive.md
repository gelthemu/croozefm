Uganda Cranes secured a crucial 1-0 victory over Guinea in a Group G clash of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers at Mandela National Stadium, Namboole, on Tuesday evening.

Following criticism for defensive lapses in their previous match against Mozambique, the Cranes delivered a disciplined and structured performance, keeping their qualification hopes alive.

Uganda dominated the early exchanges, creating several scoring opportunities. Their persistence paid off in the 36th minute when Allan Okello curled a stunning free kick into the top left corner, leaving the Guinean goalkeeper helpless.

Guinea controlled possession in spells but struggled to break through Uganda’s solid defensive pairing of Bevis Mugabi and Elio Capradossi, who effectively neutralized Borussia Dortmund striker Serhou Guirassy.

The second half saw Guinea press higher up the pitch, nearly equalizing in the 49th minute, but Cranes captain Capradossi made a vital clearance.

Goalkeeper Nafian Alionzi, who had a relatively quiet night, was called into action in the 53rd minute, making a crucial save to keep out a Guinea free kick.

Uganda responded with a counter-pressing masterclass, nearly doubling their lead in the 54th minute when Muhammad Shaban was denied by the Guinean goalkeeper.

A minute later, Okello set up Travis Mityana on a fast break, but the forward failed to convert.

The Cranes continued to pile on pressure, with Aziz Kayondo almost assisting Okello for a second goal in the 67th minute, only for a Guinean defender to clear the danger.

Guinea's final push came in the 88th minute when they earned a free kick, but Alionzi once again came to Uganda’s rescue with a crucial save.

With this victory, Uganda moves to third place in Group G with nine points, three behind leaders Algeria and Mozambique, both of whom have played one game fewer.

Uganda have beaten Guinea in both their meetings at Namboole, with Geoffrey Massa's brace in 2014 ensuring a 2-0 win.

The Cranes will return to action on September 1, 2025, when they host Mozambique in another must-win encounter at Namboole.
