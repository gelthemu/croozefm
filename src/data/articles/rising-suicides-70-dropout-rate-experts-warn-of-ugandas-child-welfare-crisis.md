Researchers have expressed concern over the Ugandan government’s failure to effectively utilize research findings to shape policies and interventions aimed at improving children’s welfare.

Despite numerous studies highlighting critical challenges affecting children, such as high teenage pregnancy rates, school dropouts, mental health struggles, and the negative impact of unregulated digital exposure, experts argue that little action has been taken to translate research into meaningful policy changes.

At the launch of the Multisectoral Child Wellbeing Forum in Ntinda, Timothy Opobo, executive director of the AfriChild Centre, emphasized the role of research in shaping effective policies.

He noted that Uganda continues to grapple with a 25% teenage pregnancy rate—one of the highest in sub- Saharan Africa—and an alarming school dropout rate of 70%, with many children failing to complete primary education.

“As researchers, we are concerned that much of the research we conduct is not translating into meaningful improvements in children’s lives. One of the main reasons is that governments are not utilizing this research to inform policies and interventions,” Opobo stated.

He highlighted additional issues such as the increasing number of children committing suicide due to academic pressure, exposure to cyberbullying, and lifestyle-related diseases like childhood obesity due to fast food consumption.

### Lack Of Data-driven Policies In Key Sectors

Uganda’s push for increased ICT training in schools to prepare children for the digital age has come with unintended consequences. Learners are being exposed to inappropriate online content and cyberbullying, leading to significant mental health struggles. Researchers argue that the absence of a regulatory framework to protect children online is a major oversight.

Opobo called for stronger collaboration between researchers and the government to establish effective policies that protect children from these risks.

“Despite children making up approximately 57% of Uganda’s population, there is inadequate research to guide policies that affect their wellbeing. Many policies are made without sufficient data, and as a result, they fail to bring real change in children’s lives,” he explained.

He also pointed out that researchers often fail to engage policymakers throughout the research process, which weakens trust in their findings and limits their impact on government decision-making.

Timothy Lubanga, a commissioner at the Office of the Prime Minister, acknowledged that children are central to Uganda’s development. He stated that their wellbeing influences national health outcomes, education, economic prosperity, and social stability.

“The wellbeing of our youngest citizens determines the future of our society. However, despite progress in child development, challenges such as malnutrition, inadequate healthcare, child labor, and violence persist. Addressing them requires adequate interventions, data-driven policies, and a multisectoral approach,” Lubanga said.

He admitted that many government interventions remain fragmented and insufficient.

“We are challenged by the fact that some of the interventions we implement are piecemeal. They are too small to create meaningful change. We are scattered all over the place, and the impact of our efforts is not being felt,” he noted.

Lubanga reaffirmed the government’s commitment to working with researchers to ensure evidence-based policymaking.

“We must actively translate findings into policies and programs that create tangible benefits for children. This forum serves as a critical platform to bridge the gap between research and action, ensuring that evidence informs decision-making at all levels,” he said.

### Law Enforcement's Role In Child Protection

Maureen Atuhaire, assistant commissioner of Police in charge of the Child and Family Protection Unit, emphasized that no single entity can address child welfare challenges alone.

She called for greater cooperation among ministries, law enforcement, and civil society organizations.

“We need to work as a team because children have diverse needs, and ensuring their well- being is crucial for enhancing human capital development,” Atuhaire stated.

She raised concerns over how ministries and government agencies handle research findings, questioning whether they use them to inform policy.

“If they do not implement research findings, they are depriving children of access to essential services,” she argued.

To protect children, the department of Community Policing and the Child and Family Protection Unit are conducting awareness campaigns in communities. These initiatives focus on defilement, child labor, child marriage, rape, and domestic violence.

Atuhaire also expressed concern over parental neglect, stating that many parents have failed in their responsibility to protect, nurture, and respond to their children’s needs. This negligence, she noted, creates opportunities for perpetrators to violate children’s rights.

With growing concerns about the well-being of children in Uganda, researchers are urging the government to prioritize evidence-based policies, invest in comprehensive child protection frameworks, and ensure collaboration among key stakeholders. The Multisectoral Child Wellbeing Forum aims to push for stronger policy implementation and greater accountability in child welfare programs.
