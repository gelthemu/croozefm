Welcome to **CFM Pulse** ("the Site"), the largest Crooze FM Fan Base.

Made by fans, this Site celebrates [91.2 Crooze FM](https://www.croozefm.com/), a radio station based in Western Uganda. We believe it to be 'Western Uganda's Biggest Radio', with **CFM Pulse** being the 'Home of Fans of Western Uganda's Biggest Radio'. There is no dispute in that. Our tagline, "By CFM Fans, for CFM Diehards," reflects our mission to unite and entertain the largest Crooze FM fan base. By accessing or using this Site, you agree to follow the terms outlined in this Legal Notice. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site.

### Ownership and Copyright

All original content on this Site—such as manually crafted photos, text, and designs—is the property of **CFM Pulse** and protected by copyright laws. However, some materials, including mixtapes, paraphrased text, and outsourced photos, are sourced from www.croozefm.com, Crooze FM DJs, or presenters’ social media accounts. We do not claim ownership of this sourced content. It remains the intellectual property of Crooze FM, its DJs, presenters, or other respective contributors. Where applicable, we provide references or citations to credit the original sources. This Site respects the rights of all content creators and aims to honor their work.

### User Responsibilities

You are welcome to enjoy this Site for personal entertainment. However, you agree not to:

- Use the Site for illegal purposes;
- Misuse sourced materials (e.g., mixtapes or photos) in ways that harm Crooze FM or its contributors;
- Engage in harmful activities like spamming the Site.

We share mixtapes and other materials solely for entertainment, with no malice, and we ask you to respect that purpose.

### Purpose and Content Redistribution

**CFM Pulse** exists to celebrate Crooze FM and its fans. We redistribute certain content—like mixtapes from www.croozefm.com, where it’s offered for public download—to enhance fan enjoyment. Paraphrased text is cited, and photos are either crafted by us or sourced with credit from Crooze FM’s website or social media. We believe this use is a fair, non-commercial tribute to Crooze FM, not a competitor to their efforts. That said, we’re not lawyers, and if Crooze FM or any rights holder disagrees, we’re open to resolving it (see **"Takedown Procedure"** below).

### Disclaimer of Liability

This Site is provided "as is." We do our best to keep it running smoothly and accurate, but we’re not responsible for:

- Errors, downtime, or technical issues;
- Any harm or loss from using the Site or relying on its content;
- Issues with sourced materials if their owners change permissions.

Use this Site at your own risk.

### Privacy Policy Reference

We care about your privacy. How we handle any data you share with us is explained in our [Privacy Policy](/policies/privacy-policy). Please review it for details.

### No Affiliation

**CFM Pulse** is an independent fan initiative. We are not officially affiliated with Crooze FM, its management, DJs, or staff. Our goal is to support and celebrate their work, not represent them.

### Takedown Procedure

If Crooze FM, its DJs, presenters, or any rights holder objects to how we’ve used their material—or believes it infringes their rights—please let us know. Contact us at [cfm@geltaverse.com](mailto:cfm@geltaverse.com), or send us a Direct Message on X at [@cfmpulse](https://x.com/cfmpulse) with:

- The specific content you’re concerned about;
- Why you want it removed or changed.

We’ll act quickly to address legitimate requests, including removing disputed material if needed. We operate in good faith.

### Governing Law

This Legal Notice follows the laws of Uganda, including the [Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act of 2006](https://media.ulii.org/media/legislation/111713/source_file/1425664146ebb8e6/2006-19.pdf) _(Act 19 of 2006)_. Any disputes about the Site or this notice will be handled under Ugandan law. Since www.croozefm.com doesn’t (as of now) provide clear licensing terms for its content, we’ve made our best effort to use it respectfully. If Crooze FM updates their terms in the future, we’ll adjust accordingly.

### Changes to This Notice

We may update this Legal Notice as needed. Any changes will be posted on this page, so check back occasionally. Your continued use of the Site after updates means you accept the new terms.

### Contact Us

For questions, takedown requests, or anything else about this Site, email us at [cfm@geltaverse.com](mailto:cfm@geltaverse.com). We’re here to listen and cooperate with all croozers and rights holders alike. Peace!
