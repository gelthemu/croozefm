Welcome to **CFM Pulse** ("the Site"), the largest Crooze FM Fan Base.

Made by fans, this Site celebrates [91.2 Crooze FM](https://www.croozefm.com/), a radio station based in Western Uganda. We believe it to be 'Western Uganda's Biggest Radio', with **CFM Pulse** being the 'Home of Fans of Western Uganda's Biggest Radio'. There is no dispute in that. Our tagline, "By CFM Fans, for CFM Diehards," reflects our mission to unite and entertain the largest Crooze FM fan base.

This Privacy Statement explains how we handle your information now and how that might change as the Site grows. Right now, we don’t collect much, but we’re planning features like authentication (logins) in the future. By using the Site, you agree to this statement. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site. We’ll update it as things evolve, so please check it regularly—continued use after changes means you accept the new terms.

### Information We Collect

At the moment, we keep it light and don’t collect sensitive personal details. Here’s what we currently gather:

- **Usernames**: If you use our live chat, we ask for a username you pick. It’s not tied to your real identity—just a username.
- **Cookies**: We use cookies to keep the Site running smoothly (e.g., loading pages, supporting chat, preventing spam). They’re stored for up to 60 days and don’t track personal info. See our [Cookies Policy](/policies/cookies-policy) for details.
- **Technical Data**: Our server logs basic stuff like your IP address, browser type, and visit time to fix issues and keep the Site secure. It’s not used to identify you.

### Future Plans (Authentication)

As this Site grows, we plan to add authentication—think logins with an email and password. When that happens, we’ll collect:

- **Email Address**: To create your account and send you updates (like password resets or Site updates).
- **Password**: Stored securely (encrypted) to let you log in.
- **Optional Info**: We might ask for extras (e.g., a display name or favorites), but you won’t have to share them.

We’ll update this statement before launching authentication and let you know. You’ll need to review it then, and signing up or logging in will mean you’re okay with the new terms.

### How We Use Your Information

We use what we collect to make **CFM Pulse** a great place for fans:

- **Usernames**: To let you chat, and see what other croozers are saying.
- **Cookies**: To improve your experience, deliver content (like mixtapes, chat messages), monitor performance, and stop abuse.
- **Technical Data**: To troubleshoot, secure the Site, and keep it running.
- **Future Authentication**: Once added, your email and password will help you access your account, stay updated, and enjoy personalized features.

We don’t sell or misuse your info—our focus is celebrating Crooze FM, not profiting off you.

### Why We Collect It (Legal Basis)

Under Uganda’s [Data Protection and Privacy Act, 2019](https://media.ulii.org/media/legislation/18002/source_file/b6ae5cce4290322a/2019-9.pdf) _(Act 9 of 2019)_, we need a reason to collect data:

- **Legitimate Interest**: Cookies and technical data keep the Site functional and safe for everyone.
- **Consent**: Using the Site (like picking a username) or signing up later (with email/password) means you agree to this policy.

### No Sensitive Personal Data (For Now)

Currently, we don’t grab things like your real name or address. Even without authentication, we’ve built **CFM Pulse** to respect your privacy. That’ll change a bit with logins, but we’ll only take what’s needed and keep you informed.

### Data Sharing

We don’t share your info with anyone right now—no third parties, no advertisers, not even Crooze FM (we’re not affiliated). In the future, with authentication, we might share limited data (like your email) with:

- **Service Providers**: To send account emails or host the Site securely.
- **Legal Requests**: If Ugandan law requires it (e.g., a court order).

We’ll always tell you first via an updated statement if sharing becomes necessary.

### Data Storage and Security

We keep what we collect safe:

- **Cookies**: Stored on your device for up to 60 days, then deleted.
- **Usernames**: Kept in our database during your chat session, then cleared.
- **Technical Data**: Logged briefly, then overwritten.
- **Future Authentication**: Emails and passwords will be encrypted and stored on a secure server.

We use standard security (like encryption and access limits), but no system is perfect. If there’s a breach, we’ll fix it fast and notify you if required by law.

### Governing Law

This statement follows Ugandan law, including the [Data Protection and Privacy Act, 2019](https://media.ulii.org/media/legislation/18002/source_file/b6ae5cce4290322a/2019-9.pdf) _(Act 9 of 2019)_. Disputes about your info fall under these rules.

### Your Rights

Uganda’s data protection laws give you control over your info, even now:

- **Access**: Ask what we have (e.g., your username or cookies).
- **Correction**: Fix errors (like a chat glitch).
- **Deletion**: Want your username or cookies gone? Tell us or clear them yourself.
- **Object**: Say no to cookies or block them, though some features might break.

With authentication, you’ll also get:

- **Account Deletion**: Close your account and wipe your data.
- **Data Portability**: Take your info (like email) elsewhere if you want.

Email us at [cfm@geltaverse.com](mailto:cfm@geltaverse.com) to use these rights. We’ll reply within 10 days.

### Children’s Privacy

**CFM Pulse** isn’t for kids under 13. We don’t knowingly collect their info. If a child’s data slips through (e.g., a username or sensitive chats), parents can email us to remove it.

### International Users

We’re in Uganda, so your info (cookies, technical data, or future account details) is processed here. If you’re outside Uganda, using the Site sends your data to us. Ugandan laws apply wherever you are.

### Changes to This Statement

We’ll update this Privacy Statement as **CFM Pulse** grows—like when we add authentication—or if laws change. Updates will be posted here with a new "Last Updated" date. Please review it regularly. Continued use of the Site (browsing now, or logging in later) after changes means you agree to the new terms. We’ll also notify you of big updates (e.g., via email once authentication starts).
