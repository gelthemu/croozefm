Welcome to **CFM Pulse** ("the Site"), the largest Crooze FM Fan Base.

Made by fans, this Site celebrates [91.2 Crooze FM](https://www.croozefm.com/), a radio station based in Western Uganda. We believe it to be 'Western Uganda's Biggest Radio', with **CFM Pulse** being the 'Home of Fans of Western Uganda's Biggest Radio'. There is no dispute in that. Our tagline, "By CFM Fans, for CFM Diehards," reflects our mission to unite and entertain the largest Crooze FM fan base. By accessing or using this Site, you're agreeing to let us use cookies to keep this beast alive and thriving indefinitely. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site.

The Site uses cookies to keep things running smoothly on your end. This Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, and what this means for you. By using the Site, you agree to our use of cookies as described here. This policy is part of our broader [Legal Notice](/policies/legal-notice), and we encourage you to read that too.

### What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device (like your phone or computer) when you visit a website. They help the site work better by remembering certain things about your visit. We use them to improve your experience on **CFM Pulse**, but we’re not collecting anything sensitive about you.

### How We Use Cookies

We use cookies for smooth operations, not to track you personally. Right now, we don’t collect sensitive personal information (like your name, email, or address). Even with features like our live chat, we only ask for a username you choose—nothing more. Cookies on **CFM Pulse** are stored for no longer than 60 days. Here’s what they help us do:

- **Keep the Site Functional**: Cookies ensure pages load properly and features like live chat work without hiccups.
- **Improve User Experience**: They remember basic preferences, like your chosen language or chat username, so you don’t have to re-enter them every time.
- **Monitor Performance**: Cookies help us see how the Site is performing (e.g., which pages load slowly) so we can fix issues.
- **Prevent Abuse**: They help us spot and stop spammy or harmful activity, even though we don’t require authentication yet.
- **Support Content Delivery**: Cookies might assist in loading mixtapes, photos, or other fan content efficiently.

### No Sensitive Data Collection

We don’t use cookies to gather personal details like your real identity, location, or contact info. Our live chat only needs a username, which you pick—it’s not tied to anything sensitive. Cookies are just for keeping the Site usable and enjoyable.

### Cookie Duration

Cookies on **CFM Pulse** are temporary. We store them for a maximum of 60 days, after which they expire and are automatically deleted from your device. You can also clear them anytime through your browser settings.

### User Responsibilities

While we haven’t added authentication (like logins or passwords) yet, that doesn’t mean the Site is open for misuse. Cookies help us watch for spamming or exploitation, and we ask you to use **CFM Pulse** respectfully. Don’t try to overload the Site, flood the chat, or misuse our resources—let’s keep this a fun space for all Crooze FM fans out here.

### Your Choices

You can control cookies through your browser. Most browsers let you block or delete them, but if you block cookies entirely, some parts of **CFM Pulse** (like live chat or content loading) might not work as well. It’s up to you, but we’ve designed cookies to enhance your experience, not invade your privacy.

### Third-Party Cookies

Right now, we don’t use third-party cookies (e.g., from advertisers or analytics tools). If that changes—like if we add a feature from an external provider—we’ll update this policy and let you know.

### Disclaimer

Cookies are part of how we offer this Site "as is." We’re not responsible for any issues (like slowdowns or glitches) if you block them or if something goes wrong with how they’re stored on your device. See our [Legal Notice](/policies/legal-notice) for more on this.

### Governing Law

This Cookies Policy follows the laws of Uganda, just like our Legal Notice. Any questions or disputes about our cookie use will be handled under Ugandan law, including the [Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act of 2006](https://media.ulii.org/media/legislation/111713/source_file/1425664146ebb8e6/2006-19.pdf) _(Act 19 of 2006)_ where applicable.

### Changes to This Policy

We might tweak this Cookies Policy as the Site grows or laws change. Updates will be posted here, so check back now and then. If you keep using **CFM Pulse** after changes, it means you’re okay with the new terms of service.

### Contact Us

Got questions about cookies or how we use them? Email us at [cfm@geltaverse.com](mailto:cfm@geltaverse.com), or send us a Direct Message on X at [@cfmpulse](https://x.com/cfmpulse). We’re happy to explain and keep things clear for you. Peace!
