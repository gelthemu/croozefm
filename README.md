**_The largest Crooze FM fan base. By CFM Fans, for CFM Diehards._**

CFM Pulse is a fan-crafted community hub for [91.2 Crooze FM](https://www.croozefm.com) listeners. Built by passionate diehards, it’s your place to chat live, share content, and celebrate all things Crooze FM.

## Features in the Works

- **Live Chat:** Real-time discussions for Crooze FM fans to connect and share.
- **Fan-Driven Content:** A space for Diehards to submit ideas, reviews, and playlists inspired by Crooze FM.
- **Community Focus:** Built by fans, for fans—no affiliation with the official 91.2 Crooze FM station.

Visit [CFM Pulse](https://cfm.geltaverse.com) to join the fan base. Jump into the live chat to connect with other CFM Diehards. Explore fan-submitted content and add your own voice to the mix.

This project aims to replicate the look and feel of the Crooze FM website; and is intended for practice, showcasing web design and development skills.
